    <h1>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</h1>
    <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</p>
    <p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! <strong> I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</strong> <em> Bite my shiny metal ass.</em> Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
    <h2>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</h2>
    <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Look, last night was a mistake. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Anyone who laughs is a communist!</li><li>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</li><li>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</h3>
    <p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? I'm Santa Claus!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</li><li>Bender, we're trying our best.</li><li>You know, I was God once.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No argument here. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
    <p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
    <p>I can explain. It's very valuable. That's not soon enough! You don't know how to do any of those. What are their names?</p>
    <p>And then the battle's not so bad? Look, last night was a mistake. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Moving along…</p>
    <p>Soothe us with sweet lies. Bite my shiny metal ass. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. No, she'll probably make me do it. Bite my shiny metal ass.</p>
    <p>Tell her she looks thin. No! Don't jump! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Fatal.</p>
    <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! You know, I was God once. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
    <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. But I've never been to the moon! Actually, that's still true. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
    <p>Bender, we're trying our best. Say it in Russian! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
    <p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Also Zoidberg. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
    <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Now what? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! It's a T. It goes "tuh". Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
